    <h1>Jack Madden</h1>
    <h3>Enterprise IT marketer and blogger</h3>
    <p>I'm currently on the product marketing team for VMware Workspace ONE.</p>
    <p>You can find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/jackmadden">Twitter</a>
      and on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/maddenjack">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
    <p>From 2011 to 2020, I was a blogger, analyst, and executive editor at TechTarget, writing for the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/eulogy-brianmaddencom-brian-madden/">now-retired website BrianMadden.com</a>, covering enterprise mobility management, "consumerization of IT" trends, identity management, desktop virtualization, and all things related to end-user computing.</p>
    <p>In 2013 I published a book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Enterprise-Mobility-Management-Everything-ebook/dp/B00DK2GHHA/">Enterprise
        Mobility Management: Everything you need to know about MDM, MAM, and
        BYOD</a>.</p>
    <h3>Music</h3>
    <p>I play bass and tenor trombone in the San Francisco Bay area. Prior to my blogging and marketing career, I studied bass trombone
      performance at the Oberlin Conservatory of Music and Duquesne University.</p>
    <p>I currently play in the <a href="http://bars-sf.org/">Bay Area Rainbow
        Symphony</a>, a community orchestra in San Francisco. I also play with a six-piece dance band that gigs around the Bay area, and do some musical theater pit orchestra work.</p>
    <p>Here are some recordings from my grad school days:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVH_VpfgOXk">Samuel Adler,
          "Canto II," first movement (YouTube)</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi-ocGL8I70">Frescobaldi,

    </ul>
